# Daily Fantasy Football Optimization
**tl;dr**  
* We developed an iterative integer programming model for generating lineups in daily fantasy football 
* We experienced limited success due to the NFL being highly unpredictable  
* We believe this model is generalizable enough to apply to other fantasy sports  
* There is still a lot of money to be made  

## Who cares?
Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) have exploded since platforms like Draftkings (2012) and Fantasy Duel (2009) were created. These markets pay out millions of dollars and are exploding with growth. A majority of this money is payed out to a small percent of players who have developed strategies that are robust to market dynamics. 

## Our Goal
The goal of any fantasy sports league is to select a group of players that will maximize the number of points that you score. Fantasy points are calculated based off of waht is happening in real sporting events. Traditionally, points are accumulated on a weekly basis and totaled at the end of the season. With DFS, decisions are made on a more frequent basis (i.e. weekly in the NFL) and thus the number of decisions to be made (and $$$) has increased dramatically. We have decided to focus on the NFL for now due to the highly unpredictable nature of the sport, as well as our team's interest in the sport. 
Our goal is to develop an *integer programming model* that determines which players to play on DraftKings NFL Competitions.  

## Model Formulation
Below we show how we translate DFS lineup generation into an optimization model where we seek to maximize the total expected points.  We assign a decision variable X_{i}
